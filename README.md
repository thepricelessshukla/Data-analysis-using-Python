# Data-analysis-using-Python
In this project i have performed the following task :
- Merged all months data into one a year data (All_Data) to perform analysis on overall 1 year data
- Made some new columns and change some columns datatype so that data should be cleaned and will be easy to work
- Analysed the data and answered 5 business question with the analysis
- and also provided some graphical measure to understand the data more easily.
- I have attached 'All_data(Raw Data)' .csv file , 'Data analysis using Python' which is a jupyter file
- libraries used Pandas, matplotlib mostly
- Open the file to see the work.
